# DEF CON 33 Official Morse Code Survival Guide 🕵️‍♂️🔇

Welcome, brave hackers, to DEF CON 33 — or what remains of it, trapped forever inside the labyrinthine nightmare of Microsoft Teams.  

Since the **“Leave”** button mysteriously vanished (RIP), and the mute button is your only lifeline, we’ve devised a foolproof plan to communicate:

## How to Speak Fluent Morse Code Using Your Mute Button 🎙️

Because typing messages is so 2020, and shouting won’t save you here, **mute toggling is the new black.**

| Morse Signal | Action                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 🔇 Mute      | *Dot* (short beep)          |
| 🔊 Unmute    | *Dash* (long beep)          |
| 🔄 Toggle    | Combine dots and dashes     |
| ⏳ Pause     | Space between letters        |
| 🚪 Escape    | Legend says... a secret sequence |

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Start with your microphone muted.** Silence is survival.  
2. **Tap mute/unmute quickly** to send “dots.” (A quick mute, quick unmute.)  
3. **Hold your unmute longer** to send “dashes.” (A longer unmute before muting again.)  
4. **Pause** briefly to separate letters — remember, patience is a virtue.  
5. **Spell out your message** letter by letter, channeling your inner telegraph operator.  
6. **Don’t forget: all organizers are trapped too, so they’re desperately listening!**

## Pro Tip: The Ultimate SOS

If you’re truly stuck, try sending the classic distress signal:  
`... --- ...` (dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot) — AKA “SOS.”  

It might get you a virtual rescue — or at least a sympathetic emoji reaction.

## Warning ⚠️

- **PowerPoint slide decks** are not reliable communication devices.  
- **Do not try to jailbreak your toaster with PowerPoint.**  
- **2FA and retina scans** may randomly interrupt your transmissions.  
- Your Wi-Fi may enter “infinite loading” mode at any moment.

Hang in there, intrepid hackers. DEF CON 33 may be a digital oubliette, but Morse code just might be your ticket out. Or at least your ticket to slightly less frustrating silence.

See you in Breakout Room 642 (Lost Souls).
